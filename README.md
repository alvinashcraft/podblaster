# Welcome to PodBlaster!

PodBlaster is a low-resource, straightforward podcast app built for Windows. Right now, you'll need to check out the code and build it in Visual Studio 2022, as I don't have an installer or distributable yet. 

If you want to play with some of the new Open AI features I'm implementing, switch over to the ai-enhancements branch and make sure you have an Azure Open AI endpoint link and key.
